This file will execute with using numbers from a text file called "data.txt".
It will read this file in the format [number of ints in the line][int 1][int 2]...[int n]
Thus this program will ignore the first number of the line. 

To run this file on flip, include the .py file in the same folder as data.txt and run
"python3 Homework1.py" on the command line on flip. 

This program sort the lists using merge sort and insert sort and will produce
two output files, the sorted lists as merge.out and insert.out
based on the alogrithm used.
